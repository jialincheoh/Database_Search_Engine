1. ensure you have the two input files you want to check in the same (isomers) directory

2. edit isomers.py at the top you will see:

INPUT_FILE_1 and INPUT_FILE_2

give them the right values (name of the two input files)

3. open terminal and get into correct directory:

cd /Users/jialincheoh/Documents/isomers

4. in terminal, run the program (this is the more restrictive check)

python3 isomers.py

-------

The less restrictive check (only checks atom counts):

python3 structural_isomers.py
